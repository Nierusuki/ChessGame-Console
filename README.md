## .NET Core - Console Chess Game
This is my first big project using object orientation programming. I created it using C# with .NET Core.
I have learnt a lot while doing this project and it is my first step on the creation of my portfolio.
It is a basic chess game, that you can play with a friend locally. 
It uses the standard chess-positioning system to receive commands, so when moving your pieces, you should give a command like **c2** or **D4**.

Because this project is made on .NET Core, you **must** have it installed to properly work.

Also, because this is my first project, and I'm still learning, I will update it as I learn new things, so I'll write a to-do list below with things I'm planning to improve or add and let you know that I'm always open to feedback and tips on how to improve my code.
### To-do list:
* ~~Pawn promotion~~
* Improve command input
* ~~Castling special move~~
* ~~En-passant special move~~
* More optimized check-mate logic
